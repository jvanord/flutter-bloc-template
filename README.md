# Flutter BLoC App Template

This is a [Flutter](https://flutter.dev) template project for an app using the [BLoC](https://pub.dev/packages/bloc) pattern. The template is based on an example app built by Conner Aldrich.
Although this template has been modified from its original form, you can read more about Conner's organization strategy [here](https://medium.com/flutter-community/flutter-code-organization-revised-b09ad5cef7f6).
